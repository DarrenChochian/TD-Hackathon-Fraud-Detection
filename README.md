# TD Hackathon – Fraud Detection

React + Electron desktop app (Vite, TypeScript).

Fraudly prevents merchant and phone fraud while it’s happening.

## Inspiration

Modern fraud targets the uninformed, happens in seconds, and is getting harder to detect as fraudsters use AI to craft convincing deceptions. We built Fraudly because prevention should happen in real time, before money is lost.

## What it does

Fraudly helps detect and prevent fraud as it happens by delivering clear, actionable warnings when high-risk behavior is detected. It is designed to:
- protect consumers during phone and online scam attempts,
- help merchants reduce fraud losses,
- build trust between businesses and customers.

## How we built it

We built Fraudly as a React + Electron app using Vite for fast iteration. The product focuses on a real-time warning experience so users can act immediately when suspicious patterns appear.

## Challenges we ran into

- Designing warnings that are fast and clear without overwhelming users.
- Handling scam scenarios that evolve quickly across channels (phone, links, social platforms).
- Building a reliable cross-platform desktop experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Turning complex fraud signals into simple, immediate warnings.
- Building an end-to-end demo that shows prevention in the moment.
- Creating a product vision that supports both consumers and businesses.

## What we learned

- Prevention timing matters more than perfect post-incident analysis.
- Even simple warnings can materially reduce fraud impact.
- User trust depends on clarity, speed, and low-friction guidance.

## What's next for Fraudly

- Expand detection coverage for merchant and phone scams.
- Improve model precision and personalization of warnings.
- Add more integrations and deeper real-time risk context.
- Run larger pilot demos with partners and user groups.

## Problem

### Fraud in 2025

- $14B worth of crypto was stolen through scams.
- Phone scams grew 1,400% year-over-year.
- Of links delivered via Discord, ~20% were phishing, ~20% malware, and ~6% linked to fraud.

### Prevention insight

- 84% of fraud can be reduced by a simple warning.
